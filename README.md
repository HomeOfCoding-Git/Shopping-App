Git doesn't like empty directories, so, you will need to create a "My Lists" dir if it doesn't already exist.


In file "connect.py", you will need to add email credentials for a gmail account, ie, gmail address and password.


NOTE: Create a dummy gmail account for testing purpose's, because gmail doesn't recognize Python as a secure source, and therefore google will block your first attempt at sending out an email, so, you will have to go into your gmail, click on the link of the warning email you received and find "Allow less secure apps".
